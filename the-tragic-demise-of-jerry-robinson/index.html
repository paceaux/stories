                    <p>Jerry Robinson pulled his finger out of his nose and the keys out of the ignition.</p>
                    <p>The car was still smoking but this was not his primary concern. The chunk of hardened mucus lodged in his proboscis that had been just out of the reach of his left pinky bothered him much more than the fact than he was dead.</p>
                    <p>He placed the severed finger on the dashboard (whose overly short fingernail was the indirect cause of his unexpected passing), unfastened the seatbelt, opened the car door and placed his mangled left foot on the ground. </p>
                        <p>As he turned slowly towards the outside world he reached back into his nose for one last try, at which time this hardened bit of mucus found its way underneath a finger nail. After removing the deceptively small mass, Jerry lay back with much satisfaction and resumed the position of his demise.</p>

                    <p>Rob stared at the screen, exhausted and giddy with what he saw: the Duolingo owl was congratulating him for having completed the entire Latin course. He was finally ready. </p>
                    <p>He ran to his shelf and pulled off the book of incantations that he'd bought on eBay. <q>I've been waiting for this,</q> he said as he gripped the book. </p>
                    <p>He flipped through the pages made of skin until he found The One. He smiled at the instructions and began speaking the Latin incantations. The lights flickered. The computer screen glitched. A smell of copper filled the room as it became almost unbearably hot. </p>
                    <p>And then it happened. A shadowy figure appeared before him.</p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob"><q>Oh shit. It worked,</q> he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">The demon responded, <q>You're surprised, Rob?</q></p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob"><q>How did you know...</q></p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">The demon cut him off, <q>yeah we've upgraded our system. Summoning is way easier now that we have universal tracking. This stuff used to be managed based on region and that was such a pain.</q></p>
                    <p>Rob ignored the comment. He issued his first command,<q>Demon, I have the name of a person I'd like for you to kill&hellip;</q></p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon"><q>Whoooa hold on there buddy, not so fast,</q> responded the dark entity. </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">Rob spoke with a puzzled voice, <q>But I summoned you. You are to do my bidding!</q></p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon"><q>Oh, hey, yeah. You summoned me. But that doesn't mean we get started right away. We gotta make sure your soul is properly bound and can't be rebound to someone else by accident. Soul-binding fraud was a serious thing back in the day. I need you to set up a password.</q></p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
                    Rob stared blankly. <q>Huh?</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
                    <q>Yeah man, a password. So look at the prompt on your screen and write in a password.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To Rob's shock, his browser window was closed. In fact, all his windows were closed. Except one, displaying text in a Papyrus font with red letters. It read, <samp>Please create a password</samp>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Rob feverishly typed, <code>deathbook</code> and pressed <kbd>submit</kbd>. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon"">
                    The demon spoke from behind him, <q>Your password has to have one uppercase letter and one number.</q>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Rob saw a <kbd>clear password</kbd> button manifest. He clicked it, and typed again, <code>Deathbo0k</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon"">
                    <q>And also a special character,</q> remarked the dark spirit behind him. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Rob again cleared the field and typed, <code>Deathbo0k!</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
                    It volunteered, <q>oh, the first letter can't be uppercase. And no sentence punctuation.</q>
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
                    Rob grunted, <q>what the hell,</q> as he typed <code>dEathbo0k^</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
                    The demon sighed as it admonished him, <q>hey man you can't also just make it the name of the thing. Come on now. Anyone could guess that.</q>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    He would not be swayed this easily. He knew what was at stake. His mechanical keyboard echoed throughout the house as he typed, <code>b0okOfDea^th</code> and mashed the <kbd>return</kbd> key. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
                    In a monotone voice the spirit spoke again, <q>yeah that's not long enough.</q>
                    </p>

                    Rob screamed. But an hour later he finally was able to appease the fallen angel's demands by writing <code>pl3Ã¡se-kill_IV_(@ny_one)*i-fasdbnm<>/\</code> and turned to face the spirit that he now commanded. 

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
                    <q>There! Happy now?</q>
                    </p>

                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
                    The demon puffed on its e-cigarrette and calmly said, <q>Cool. Can you write that one more time to confirm?</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Rob's eyes grew big as he turned and faced the screen again, only to see another field with a button below that read, <samp>confirm your password</samp>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <q>God. Damnit,</q> was Rob's only utterance. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
                    <q>Yeah we don't know why He insisted on Papyrus,</q> remarked the spirit. 
                    </p>
                    </article>
                    <article class="story__part story__part--2">
                    <p>
                        Two sleepless days later, Rob had done it. His password was complete. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
                        He turned from his coffee-cup littered desk and proclaimed, <q>now will you do my bidding,</q> at a wholly unperturbed demon. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
<q>Oh yeah sure. Just enter the name of the person you want to kill on the screen.</q>

                    </p>
                    <p>
Rob again turned to face his computer and saw a new window. The prompt read, <samp>Enter the (user)name of the person (Case sensitive)</samp>.

                    </p>
                    <p>
He typed the name and smashed the <kbd>return</kbd> key in triumph. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
<q>There, let's do this!</q>
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
<q>Are you sure,</q> asked the entity. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
<q><strong>YES</strong>,</q> Rob responded in frustration.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
<q>Then click, <samp>I'm Sure</samp> there at the bottom.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
He clicked. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
<q><em>Really sure</em>,</q> emphasized the voice from behind.

                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
<q>Arrrgh. <b>YES</b>,</q> exclaimed Rob as he again clicked a Papyrus-styled button. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
<q>Ok did you read our terms and conditions?</q>

                    </p>
                    <p>
Light faded from Rob's eyes as his screen filled with text written in a tiny font. The lines covered the full width and height of his screen. He saw a near imperceptible scroll bar at the far right.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--rob">
Rob eyed the scroll bar and dragged it to the bottom of the screen.  He laughed maniacally for the full day as he scrolled to the bottom. When he finally reached the end he shouted, <q>DONE,</q> as he again turned to the demon. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="story__dialog story__dialog--demon">
<q>Dude, come on. I know you didn't actually read that. You gotta actually read the terms and conditions.</q>

                    </p>
                    <p>
The light left Rob's eyes as he turned back to the screen and saw that his scroll bar was back at the top of the screen.

                    </p>
                    <p>
He wept.
